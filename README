Fdb - FoundationDB Perl Interface

Use Fdb to interface with FoundationDB. It is based on the C API, so please
read the documentation on the FoundationDB website.

The Perl interface differs from the C one in 2 cases:

* where C methods expect tuples of (string, string_length), in Perl disregard
the need for string_length

* where C methods expect an output parameter (e.g. FDBCluster **out_cluster),
in Perl you instead do not pass it in but get it as a 2nd item in the output of
the method.

        use Fdb;
        Fdb::select_api_version(Fdb::FDB_API_VERSION);
        Fdb::setup_network();
        Fdb::run_network();
        my $cluster_f = Fdb::create_cluster(undef);
        Fdb::future_block_until_ready($cluster_f);
        my $err;
        if (Fdb::future_is_error($cluster_f)) {
          Fdb::future_get_error($cluster_f, $err);
          warn $err;
        }
        my $res;
        my $cluster_handle = undef;
        ($res, $cluster_handle) = Fdb::future_get_cluster($cluster_f);
        Fdb::future_destroy($cluster_f);
        my $db_f = Fdb::cluster_create_database($cluster_handle, "TEST_DB");
        Fdb::future_block_until_ready($db_f);
        my $db_handle;
        ($res, $db_handle) = Fdb::future_get_database($db_f);
        Fdb::future_destroy($db_f);

        Fdb::database_destroy($db_handle);
        Fdb::cluster_destroy($cluster_handle);
        Fdb::stop_network();


With the exceptions described above, all the subroutines have the same
names and parameters as the C API.
